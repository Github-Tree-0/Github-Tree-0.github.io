I'm a first-year MSCS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, under the supervision of Prof. Yuxiong Wang. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at Peking University, where I was mentored by Prof. Boxin Shi.

My primary research interests center on the fascinating intersections of computer vision and machine learning, with a specific emphasis on **3D vision**. My work involves tasks related to **reconstructing** real-world scenes and subsequently **editing** these reconstructed environments.

- I have experience in Photometric Stereo and possess relative knowledge in rendering.
- Currently, I'm actively exploring NeRF-like methods.
